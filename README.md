SimpleFIC
=========

Huber Fractal Image Compression. It was part of my master's proposed thesis.

SimpleFIC is encoder/decoder for robust fractal image compression technique; An iterative image compression method, based on self-similarities of a single image.

Among other things... although this implementation tends to illustrate Huber regression's unseen effects and outcomes in this particular application, on some parts, that good old simple regression was used!

The result and complete methods are detailed in ["Study on Huber fractal image compression,"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336305) 2009, written by by *Jeng JH, Tseng CC, Hsieh JG*.
