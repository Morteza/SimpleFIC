=========

* (Simple Fractal Image Compression)*

SimpleFIC is encoder/decoder for robust fractal image compression technique; An iterative image compression method, based on self-similarities of a single image.

Although this implementation tends to illustrate Huber regression's unseen effects and outcomes in this particular application, on some parts, that good old simple regression was used!

The result and complete method is described here: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336305]()[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336305]()
