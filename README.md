SimpleFIC
=========

SimpleFIC is a decoder/encoder to compress images using fractal image compression method; implemented in partial fulfillment for my master thesis.

SimpleFIC is a demonstration of a robust fractal image compression technique; an iterative image compression method, based on self-similarities of a single image. This particular implementation tends to illustrate Huber regression's unseen effects and outcomes. However on some parts, good old fashion linear regression is used. Jeng et al. (2009) describes Huber applications in FIC (["Study on Huber fractal image compression"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336305)).
